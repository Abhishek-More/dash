# Dash

Virtual Driving assistant which aims to bring smart car features to every car.

Dash sits on your car dashboard and sees what you see. Unlike a human, it's able to process everything it sees without distraction. Dash will alert the driver of lane departure and closely approaching cars. It also detects stop signs, traffic lights, and pedestrians. Lastly, it features crash detection, which integrates with Twilio to alert emergency contacts in case of an accident.

Tech used:
* SvelteKit
* OpenCV
* Tensorflow
* Twilio
